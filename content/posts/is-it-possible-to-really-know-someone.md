I forgot where I first heard this, and if someone can tell me the source, I’d
gladly cite them here. So here it goes:

> Given the near-limitless size of the universe and the terribly small size of
> our capacity to save information, isn’t it more correct to say that, relative
> to the total knowledge available in the universe, our knowledge would always
> be closer to nothing than everything?

These words came to the forefront of my mind a week ago, after finishing The
Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. They’ve stayed with me since, and I feel like writing
them down to release some of the thoughts that have been bugging me.

Let me backtrack a little.

The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a book by Haruki Murakami, and it’s excellent. I
read it once a long time ago and forgot most of it.

This happens to me often.

My memory isn’t great, especially lately with everything going on around me. And
in my defence, when I said "a long time ago," it was over a decade ago.

During this summer vacation, I had the opportunity to visit a bookstore that
sells English books with my family. My wife picked up a book titled
["Antifragile"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34656246-antifragile) by
Nassim Nicholas Taleb, while I chose a book by Haruki Murakami. Although I
initially considered getting [a collection of short
stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18295942-blind-willow-sleeping-woman)
by him, "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" caught my attention, so I decided to buy
it.

The book itself was excellent, and I may do a full review someday. However, what
particularly caught my attention was a chapter where the protagonist gets into a
fight with his wife.

> *"Why did you buy this stuff?" she asked, her voice weary.*
>
> *Holding the wok, I looked at her. Then I looked at the box of tissues and the
> package of toilet paper. I had no idea what she was trying to say.*
>
> *"What do you mean? They’re just tissues and toilet paper. We need those
> things. We’re not exactly out, but they won’t rot if they sit around a little
> while."*
>
> *"No, of course not. But why did you have to buy blue tissues and
> flower-pattern toilet paper?"*
>
> *"I don’t get it," I said, controlling myself. "They were on sale. Blue
> tissues are not going to turn your nose blue. What’s the big deal?"*
>
> *"It is a big deal. I hate blue tissues and flower-pattern toilet paper.
> **Didn’t you know that?**"*
>
> -- <cite>Haruki Murakami, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</cite>

After the fight, the protagonist made up with his wife (I’m simplifying here)
and realised he didn’t know some things about her despite being married for
years. He wondered if it was because he wasn’t attentive enough. He thought that
if he had paid more attention, he would have known that his wife disliked blue
tissues and flower-patterned toilet paper.

But even if he did pay attention to those things, he might still overlook other
things about his wife. They might have another fight in the future about
something like him not knowing that his wife hates a certain piece of furniture.
Or vice versa. No one could be sure.

This led to his musings at the beginning of the chapter: is it possible for two
people to fully understand each other?

This year marks the fifth anniversary of my wife and me living together under
one roof and in one apartment room. We spend most of our time in close proximity
to each other, except when we are at work. We can confidently say that we know
each other quite well.

However, we still sometimes surprise each other. For example, like I said above,
when we were browsing the rows of books at the English bookstore, my wife picked
up the book "Antifragile" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

At first, I wasn’t surprised, as I know she likes reading nonfiction and is into
psychology and self-improvement books. But when I asked her why she picked it,
she said, "I saw it mentioned in ‘Ikigai,’ another book that I read, and I’ve
been interested in it ever since the concept was explained in that book."

That surprised me. Although I know she has a book titled "Ikigai" at home and
has read it, I don’t know what she read in it, and I certainly didn’t know she
was interested in the concept of "Antifragile" to the point of wanting to buy a
book about it.

Like the main character in Murakami’s book, I realised that I don’t fully know
my wife. A voice inside me said, "That’s only because you’ve been living with
her for just five years. If it were longer, you would know her much better."
It’s true that I might know her better if we were together for longer, but I
still wouldn’t know everything about her, would I?

Just like me not knowing my siblings or parents fully, even though I basically
lived with them for a very long time until my teenage years.

A critical part of my brain questions, "What do you mean by ‘knowing’? What do
you mean by ‘fully knowing’?" Instead of engaging in a philosophical discussion
or argument, I consulted dictionaries for answers, particularly regarding the
first question.

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/knowing) defines
"knowing" as having or reflecting knowledge, information, or intelligence about
something. [Dictionary.com](http://dictionary.com/) provides a similar
definition, stating that "knowing" means having knowledge or information and
being intelligent.

The common theme among these definitions is the possession of information.
Therefore, to "know" something means to possess information about it.

Fully knowing something means possessing all information about it. However, is
this even possible?

---

It’s probably still very difficult to imagine the state of "fully knowing". For
that I’d like to give an example with Python, a curious programming language
that I like a lot.

So let’s say I want to create an object in Python, and make it so that other
things in the program can know it fully. The processes mainly involve the
following steps:

1. Create an object.
2. Assign properties and attributes to that object.
3. Allow others to check its properties to obtain the information regarding it
   or use it for other goals.

Here is a simple example:

```python
# Define the object
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.height = 175
        self.hair = "black"
        self.hobby = "coding"
 
# Create a variable with that object
ahmad = Person()
 
# Check all of ahmad's properties to fully know it:
print(ahmad.height)
print(ahmad.hair)
print(ahmad.hobby)
```

And that’s it. You and everything else in the running program now can know all
the properties of a variable called ‘ahmad’. You can confidently say that you
fully understand it.

However, humans are not so easily defined.

For instance, how can we define a person and all of their characteristics?

Certainly, we can ask them detailed questions to determine their traits and
classify them into a particular MBTI type. Additionally, we can scan their
entire body to determine the dimensions and surfaces of their body, as well as
the inside of their body to determine the dimensions, shapes, and forms of their
organs.

Is that everything?

Not quite, because how can we be sure to capture every single wrinkle on their
face? The exact diameter of their nose, down to the smallest possible scale? The
precise color shades of their eyes, down to the cell by cell level? And while
we’re discussing cells, can we determine the forms, shapes, and positions of
each and every cell in their body?

Let’s set aside the physical measurements. How can we be certain that they
honestly responded to the MBTI or personality test?

Without all of that, we can’t claim to know all of a person’s characteristics,
and therefore, we can’t claim to know someone entirely.

---

Never forget that no two people are exactly alike. Even the most identical of
twins have unique fingerprints and different life experiences.

In a literal sense, everyone is unique.

---

This shouldn’t have surprised me as much as it does, but I have come to the
realization that, in conclusion, we will never fully know or understand others.

And forget about other people, we probably will never fully know ourselves
neither.

Thus, should we abandon all hope of ever knowing someone fully?

And if that’s the case, do we feel okay of simply live with someone, work with
others, rely our livelihoods on people that we will never know fully?

Certainly there should be some kind of threshold of knowing others. There must
be some kind of "acceptable level" of knowing for a relationship to work between
people.

And maybe, once we reach that level, we would have certain level of faith with
one another so that we can have peace with one another through that faith,
hoping that that level is correct, sufficient, enough.
