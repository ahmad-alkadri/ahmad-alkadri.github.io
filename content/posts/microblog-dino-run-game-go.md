Started out as a kind of joke out of complete boredom.

Ended up probably another one of my long weekend projects.

Written in Go, playable in Terminal. Honestly not know yet how to realize it fully but feature list so far:

1. ~~A T-rex~~ âœ…
2. ~~A T-rex that looks like it's running~~ âœ…
3. ~~A T-rex that looks like it's running and, when the space bar's clicked, it can jump~~ âœ…
4. ~~The ground that looks like it's moving and always changing~~ âœ…
5. Cactuses, appearing with random but jumpable spacing
6. Cactuses, appearing with random but jumpable spacing that can render the game over if hit by the T-rex
7. Some flying dino (pterodactyls) appearing with random but avoidable spacing that can hit you too

Ideas are welcome. Gonna post updates here too.
