Some of the most influential figures in my life, I encountered them in France.
One of those people, one that I have personally worked very close with
and one that I am still feeling very grateful of their guidances and aides,
told me something that stuck with me for years.

> We need to justify our salary

He said this in the middle of an ordinary day, when we were on our way back to
the office after lunch time. Lunchtime, if you didn't know, was quite a luxurious
time in France. People left the office together, went out into the open air,
walked far away just to buy a sandwich, or a baguette, or eating together
in the *Restaurant Universite*. It was one of those slow day where we spent
the whole lunchtime joking around, me making a full use of my (finally) good-enough
French, understanding everything and enjoying the times with my colleagues.

Then we went back to our office, and, while walking quite briskly, quickly
(because wow it was already almost 2PM; we've spent almost two hours outside?),
they said that thing to me.

> *Faut justifier le salaire*

I was young, far younger than I am now, and I just arrived to work in Europe,
and that sentence stuck in my head.

I need to justify my salary. I need to justify my worth. My value.

*I need to show these people that I'm worth to keep around and to live among them.*

So that was what I did. I toiled. I worked. I somehow finished my doctoral contract.
I defended my thesis, I applied for jobs. Lots of them rejected me. Interviews after
interviews. Then somehow I got accepted to work for a startup in Luxembourg.
I left academia behind and jumped straight feet first to the industry. 
To the tech world.

I kept working hard. Keeping my heads down, following the rules.
I and my wife moved fully to Luxembourg. Our first child was born. I kept working.
The company was in trouble, it was COVID era, money was difficult, people
were leaving. 

I kept working.

My child started talking. The buses were never in-time anymore. 

People became aggressive in the street. In the trains. 

Streets were smelly, people leering at me my wife and my child whenever we passed by the stores. Men and women squatting in front of buildings. Sometimes staring a bit too long.

I kept working.

A store closed down the street. A bicycle I rented was stolen. The manager told me the location of the bike with the embedded GPS and told me to get it or face penalties. 

I kept working.

Company was getting better. More and more skilled people joining in. Projects
coming in. 

One month before the due date, before the expected arrival of my
second child, we were kicked out of the apartment because apparently the
contract was saying they only allowed three people. I protested, saying
I had called and talked with the *proprietaire* about my wife's pregnancy 
months before and it seemed that everything was okay. 

It was not. They didn't care.

I got a month to find a new apartment.

I kept working.

After the sixth rejection (that I found out through a phone call just before
I got onto my *trottinette* to go home from the office), I finally stopped.

I sat down on a bench and was silent for a while. I had offered the real estate agent 
to pay the lump sum of the full year of rent. Money was not a problem for me
back then. My wife was about to give birth in three weeks and I just want a warm
house for her and my children. 

Autumn in Luxembourg was cold. Winter was very cold.

So many things had happened up until that point, and much more things were about
to happen from that point onward--things I didn't know yet at that time.

In unofficial order, those things were:
- My packages kept getting put into the post office instead of my home, even when I was at home
- People spat at me on the street
- An old lady yelling at me in Luxembourgish in the street and when I asked what did she say she spat
- Prices kept getting higher and higher
- Insurance who didn't want to cover damage
- My *trottinette* got stolen after I left it only for five minutes outside a store. Broke the *antivol*. Nobody saw what happened

Thousands of tiny things. Million little cuts.

I wondered: all this time I kept having to justify myself. Why had never Luxembourg--France--Europe--ever have to justify themselves to me?

Was it because there were simply too many migrants, too many people trying to make
it there, so that--just like a simple supply-demand principle--they could do whatever they want with no consequence?

(Somewhere in my brain, an image of Ed Sheeran singing *[You Need Me I Don't Need You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXvzzTICvJs)* showed up, except his face was replaced by the EU Flag)

> [Three Months In Japan](/posts/three-months-in-japan/)

I read 1Q84 long time ago in my own language. I have re-read it several times since.

Every single time I noticed small things that I didn't notice before. 

One of them is that how, in one of the chapters inside that thick tome of a book, 
one of the main characters said how *It is impossible to live without hope.* 
And to put it simply, it all felt hopeless back then.

But then, in the same paragraph, she also said, *When granted hope, a person uses it as fuel, as a guidepost to life*. 

And that was basically what happened to me.

I had to move. I simply couldn't justify myself being there anymore. I had to leave.

I liked a lot of people back there. Some people had taught me a lot. Some literally
made me learn Golang and made me able to do my hobby these days, which is making
(and playing) terminal games. My first year in Luxembourg made me study Rust and .NET. 

I learned a lot. My two children were born there. I was grateful.

But now, simply, there was no justification for me to stay there anymore.

So we left Europe and started our new life in Japan. We were hopeful. 

We hoped our new apartment was good.

We hoped our kids like it.

We hoped my new job was good and allow for a lot of learning opportunity and 
career growth.

And, six months in, honestly, it still feels like one of the best life decisions we've ever made.
