My name is Ahmad Alkadri. You can find out more about me profesionally
on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alkadri). Sometimes I travel and took photos.

I came to Europe in 2015, specifically to France,
for my Master's study. Originally, I came from the field of Forestry.
Due to some weird course of fate, I became entangled in the field of wood acoustics,
wrote a scientific article about violin wood, and worked as an Applied Researcher
in the R&D department of Henri SELMER Paris–one of the best clarinet manufacturer
in the world, and then as a Simulation and Software Engineer at [Leko Labs](https://lekolabs.com),
a Luxembourg startup focusing on building wooden houses with robotics systems.

Today, I work as a software engineer for [Tektome Inc.](https://tektome.com), a Japanese
company specialised in using AI in the AEC fields. And nowadays I also work a lot more 
with Python and Go for backend works. 

In my spare time I read books, play music, or travel.
I don’t know yet what will I do with this blog (maybe just blogging codes), but for now,
I'll just make it as another one of my little corners on the web.
