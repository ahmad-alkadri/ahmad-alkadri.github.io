There are lots of things changing in my life right now, 
and with more spare time than ever, I finally got the time 
and space to rewrite this blog. I removed all the unnecessary 
R-hugo clutters and decided to go full Hugo instead. 
After all, KISS–Keep It Stupid Simple–has managed to 
save me more often than I dare to admit this year.
