Effectively this ends all twitter scraper. Even those that have been used since a longtime by so many people like Nitter. And yes, the developers of Nitter have realized this too–the repo has been alight with discussions.\nToday, Musk finally confirmed, via Twitter, the changes that have happpened. Well, kinda, though, because he didn’t directly addressed it; rather, he said something that I think even worse: all accounts on Twitter are now rate-limited, with the newly unverified accounts can only read 300 tweets per day, old unverified accounts 600 tweets per day, and finally, verified accounts up to 6000 tweets per day.\nMind you, to get yourself verified on Twitter, you’ll have to pay. Musk is saying that these changes are done to address “extreme levels of data scraping \u0026 system manipulation”, but honestly, I don’t buy it. Data scraping is practically unavoidable in the open internet; from search engine to hobbyist (like myself) and even government agencies everybody is doing it, and there are ways to handle it, to prevent it from overburdening your system. IP limiters, device detections… seriously, you can even implement it easily on your app with Flask-Limiter. I don’t see how a company as big as Twitter cannot implement one of these alternative solutions, anything other than what they’re doing right now…\nAnyway, Musk has went on to said that these changes are probably “temporary”. Well, I don’t know if it’s gonna be temporary or not, can’t really trust the words of “higher-ups” these days, but for now I’ve decided to put Tweet Cloud Maker to sleep and put my work on pytterrator on pause. With Nitter also not functioning, I can only say:\nSo long, and thanks for all the tweets\n",
